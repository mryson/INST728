    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>My name is Matthew Ryson and I am a student at the University of Maryland studying Human-Computer Interaction.</p>

    <p>I work with the Trace Research and Development Center and help with accessibility research and usability as a graduate research assistant. In the future, I would like to see a day when all devices come equipped with software to aid people with
        disabilities so that all populations can experience computers and technology equally. This is especially important as new technologies emerge in popularity such as devices that use virtual and augmented reality.</p>

    <p>In my free time, I like to create infographics and animations using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe After Effects. I also enjoy playing video games and would like to learn how to play the bass guitar. I drive a blue Volvo C30 and take great care
        in keeping my car in like-new condition. Currently, my favorite television show is The Alienist.</p>

    <h3>List of foods I like</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Avocados</li>
        <li>Strawberries</li>
        <li>Zucchini Casserole</li>
    </ul>
